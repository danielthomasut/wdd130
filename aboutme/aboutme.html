    <h2>My name is Daniel Thomas</h2>
    <h2>I go by Danny</h2>
    <p>I live in northern Utah with my wife. I have been married about a year and a half now. I am originally from Pennsylvania</p>
       <P></P> My degree path is applied technology. I love playing video games on PC and was always curious how their websites, apps and design worked</p>
        <p> I am a convert to the church. I got baptized 10 years ago</p>
        <p>I love the outdoors so most of my favorite hobbies include being outside.</p>
          <p>I got out of the military last year so I am going to school to make a career change.
         I tried higher education before, but it didn't work out to well.
         I beleive going to a church owned/operated school will be a better fit for me</p>
             <p> My favorite talk is by Jeffrey R. Holland called " A Saint through the Atonement of Christ the Lord" 
                 One of my favorite scriptures is Moroni 7:33 If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me.
