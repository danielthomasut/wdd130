      </p>So, you have made the decision to visit the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Smart move. The other smart move was coming to this website as oppose to other travel websites. My name is Danny Thomas. I spent majority of my life living in “PA” (locals refer to Pennsylvania as just “PA”) Sure you could go visit the top tourist destinations and come out with a slight experience, or you could go by my recommendations and get the full PA experience. We all know (and love) Philadelphia. So much history, museums and major sports teams that play there. But there is also much to do in other smaller cities and towns? This website will dive deep into those small towns and why you should visit them. This website will also go into food. I know what you’re thinking! Cheesesteaks! Check out my food recommendations page and you’ll see my top picks for the best cheesesteaks. Surprise! None of them are in Philly.  For all you outdoor enthusiast, this website will include some of the best camping sights that I have personally stayed at over and over again, and trails you should seriously consider hiking. You will fit right in PA by using my website and not look like a lost tourist using others.

      <h3>[FOOD]</h3>
      <p>
        []
      </p>Cheesesteaks are the first thing on your mind when it comes to delicious food in PA. And most likely Philadelphia crosses your mind as to where to get the best cheesesteaks. But that couldn’t be further from the truth. Tourist sites will tell you to go to Pat’s or Geno’s in south Philly. No local goes to those places. The lines are long from all the visitors.  Although Philly does certainly have a few locations that do cheesesteaks right, you don’t have to go into Philly to experience an amazing cheesesteak.  Just outside Philadelphia are Bucks and Lehigh County. In Bucks County, I highly recommend Lee’s Hoagie house and Giovanni’s.  Both have high ratings and are really good. In Lehigh Valley the best cheesesteaks are Sewards in Allentown and Wiz Kidz in Bethlehem. The lines here aren’t nearly as long as the one’s in Philly and you don’t have to deal with traffic or those pesky tourists.  Perogies are also really popular in PA. Think mashed potatoes stuffed in a pocket of bread. They are buttery and usually you get them with salt and ketchup. I don’t think I have ever been to a restaurant in PA that didn’t have a side of perogies with your meal.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Small Towns. Lots of fun]</h3>
      <p>Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are great cities to visit and have a lot to offer. But Pennsylvania is a big state and there is so much more to it then just the big cities. There are smaller cities and towns you should check out while in PA. Lancaster, Hershey, State College, Jim Thorpe, and Centralia to just name a few. Lancaster, Reading and Kutztown are home to the Amish. Amish are a strict religious Christian group of German descent. Most don’t use any electricity or drive cars. They do everything by hand. The best and longest lasting furniture is made by them. They also have food stands on the side of the roads selling pies and vegetables. Hershey “the sweetest place on Earth” is home to the worlds best chocolate. Take a tour of the Chocolate factory, go on some crazy rides at Hershey park, and visit ZooAmerica.  State College is home to Penn State University. One of the largest universities in the country. If you like football, go to a PSU game at Beaver Stadium. Beaver stadium is the 3rd largest general stadium in the world! Jim Thorpe is nicknamed “little Switzerland of America” nestled in the Poconos. Centralia is a ghost town literally on fire. It was the bases of the horror video game turned movie called “Silent Hill”
