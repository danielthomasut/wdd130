        <p>Cheesesteaks are best served in PA. However, not neccessarily in Philly. Cities and townships outside Philly have the best cheesesteaks. My opinion, Lehigh Valley is number 1. When you do decide to enjoy a cheesesteak, chose wisely which cheese you prefer. There is a real debate and bitterness between "whiz" fans and "american" fans. Some restruants will only serve with either whiz or american. Only a few places offer cheese options. I'm a whiz guy. The cheesier, the better. </p>
