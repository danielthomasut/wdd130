      Cheesesteaks are the first thing on your mind when it comes to delicious food in PA. And most likely
     Philadelphia crosses your mind as to where to get the best cheesesteaks. But that couldn't be further from the
     truth. Tourist sites will tell you to go to Pat's or Geno's in south Philly. No local goes to those places. The
     lines are long from all the visitors. Although Philly does certainly have a few locations that do cheesesteaks
     right, you don't have to go into Philly to experience an amazing cheesesteak. Just outside Philadelphia are Bucks
     and Lehigh County. In Bucks County, I highly recommend Lee's Hoagie house and Giovanni's. Both have high ratings and
     are really good. In Lehigh Valley the best cheesesteaks are Sewards in Allentown and Wiz Kidz in Bethlehem. The
     lines here aren't nearly as long as the one's in Philly and you don't have to deal with traffic or those pesky
     tourists. Perogies are also really popular in PA. Think mashed potatoes stuffed in a pocket of bread. They are
     buttery and usually you get them with salt and ketchup. I don't think I have ever been to a restaurant in PA that
     didn't have a side of perogies with your meal.</p>
